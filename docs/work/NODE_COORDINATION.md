# C++ node networking coordination

## Hetzner baseline — 2026-09-26

The authorized checkout is `/opt/zclassic-money`, the C++ Zclassic node.
Branch `agent/hetzner-networking-20260926` starts at
`28971f6154de6b91bd842357e53675d17addbc77`, preserving the complete history of
`fix/timeout-overflow-20260916`. The C23 checkout is outside this assignment.

Two inherited commits are ahead of the old branch's tracking ref:

- `5f7c0d59ba974e92d6add40428973b1803799b8f`: receive queue accounting uses
  saturating `size_t` arithmetic and tests message overhead.
- `28971f6154de6b91bd842357e53675d17addbc77`: miner thread requests are bounded
  by available cores, with deterministic boundary coverage.

Fetching the publication remote showed both commits already exist on separate
fix branches. They are preserved unchanged, not new networking work.

The initial tracked working tree and index were clean. The untracked `mission/`
tree occupied 3.8 GiB, with 585 top-level regular files and 156 immediate
subdirectories (including the root in that count). It contains prior fixtures,
measurement reports, build outputs and preserved sanitizer/source worktrees.
It remains untouched and excluded from commits. The existing stash of unfinished
misbehavior work also remains untouched. No running daemon or compiler was found
in the initial process inspection; no service or canonical datadir is modified.

## Ownership

Hetzner owns IBD networking, peer scheduling, timeout/disconnect recovery,
headers/blocks flow, adversarial-network handling and node observability.
Worldstream owns storage, pruning, database, restart performance and resource
efficiency. Its fetched `dev/ibd-performance-20260918` head is
`3b9205df010b98153497934c2cfaebf940246c27` (live-prune documentation).
No Worldstream source is being duplicated or merged into this networking slice.

Only this development branch may be pushed. Consensus predicates, PoW,
monetary policy, transaction validity, upgrade behavior and chain history remain
unchanged. Tests use local isolated fixtures; raw mission evidence, datadirs,
wallets, credentials, logs and build artifacts are never staged.

## Invalid foreign block replies and request ownership

The C++ scheduler already bounds one peer to 128 requests against a 4,096-block
window. Existing timeout/disconnect tests establish immediate release before the
last peer reference is destroyed. Inspection instead found a request-ownership
violation in the preliminary block-rejection path.

Before the fix, a second peer could send the valid header of an assigned block
with a mismatching transaction body. `CheckBlock` correctly rejected the body,
but `ProcessNewBlock` still removed the first peer's matching request. The
production-message regression measured 128 requests becoming 127, an oldest
request deadline changing from 300 to 375 seconds, and changed request order.
Five assertions failed. The invalid-owner control already passed.

Request removal now optionally checks the recorded owner under `cs_main`.
Preliminary-invalid network replies use that restriction. Valid cross-peer
replies, invalid owner replies, local processing, forced processing, and normal
timeout/disconnect cleanup retain their existing behavior. No block-checking,
acceptance, PoW, transaction, monetary, upgrade, or serialization rule changed.
This claim concerns preliminary-invalid replies; later contextual or storage
rejections retain their existing behavior.

After the fix, both ownership cases pass (1,090 assertions). The healthy owner's
128 requests and original deadline remain unchanged after the foreign invalid
reply. The owner-invalid case releases the missing block and a healthy peer
claims it on its next send tick at the same simulated timestamp. Valid foreign
delivery still advances the fixture chain. All 42 download cases pass, including
64,678 assertions, held-reference cleanup, randomized reassignment, malformed
framing, header progress and import-pause recovery.

The separate candidate daemon reaches `Done loading` in an isolated regtest
fixture with wallet, external connections and bootstrap disabled, then exits 0
after SIGTERM. Binary inspection reports full RELRO, stack canary, NX, PIE, and
no RPATH/RUNPATH. The source change has an independent ownership/locking and
consensus-scope review. Broad and sanitizer results are recorded below when
complete; no mainnet IBD throughput or production deployment is claimed.

Next: reproduce header-source failover under civil-clock corrections before
changing its timer. Public RPC epoch fields must retain their meaning.

Final validation for this slice:

- Full rebuilt Boost suite: 481/481 cases, 143,426,512 assertions, 520.56 seconds.
  This includes PoW, Equihash, subsidy, block, transaction and script checks.
- GoogleTest `UpgradesTest.*`: 6/6 activation/epoch cases.
- ASan/UBSan with leak detection: 2/2 ownership cases in 5.52 seconds and all
  42 download cases in 206.77 seconds, with no sanitizer findings. Only
  `main.cpp` and `block_download_tests.cpp` were instrumented; remaining objects
  and dependencies used the normal build. Whole-program coverage is not claimed.
- Whitespace/diff checks and independent source review passed. No validation
  predicate, threshold, timeout constant or assertion was weakened.

The measured source is base `28971f6154de6b91bd842357e53675d17addbc77`
plus the two-file source/test patch with SHA256
`f3127f010321efd5ff2ae614a9be16fe4b737d138eda9b69c9eb91051c1554b2`.
Raw evidence and candidate binaries remain outside Git. These fixture checks do
not establish fresh mainnet sync, sustained peer diversity, or historical-chain
acceptance; those remain separate observations.

## Header-sync expiry under civil-clock corrections

A deterministic two-clock regression reproduced seven failures in the former
wall-time header timeout. A backward wall step retained the expired source's
header role and prevented the healthy source from issuing `getheaders`; a
forward step disconnected the source before its elapsed 900-second allowance.
The test varies wall time by plus/minus 3,600 seconds while independently
advancing elapsed time through 899 seconds, 900 seconds and 900 seconds + 1 us.

Header deadline creation, verified-progress refresh and expiry now share a
process-local monotonic clock. Its origin makes values nonnegative, zero remains
reserved, and test overrides are independent of the wall clock. The allowance
remains 15 minutes with the same strict greater-than expiry boundary. Role
cleanup, preferred-source priority and import-pause handling are unchanged.

`getpeerinfo` retains its existing epoch `header_sync_deadline`, projected from
current wall time plus the monotonic remainder with saturation at `INT64_MAX`.
`header_sync_timeout_remaining` comes directly from that remainder. The RPC
regression covers both civil-time directions and epoch saturation while retaining
a 900-second remainder. Expired but not yet cleaned-up roles project to the
observation time and report zero remaining; the scheduler still owns cleanup.

The final focused suite passes 44 cases and 65,787 assertions in 51.62 seconds.
It covers exact expiry, immediate healthy-source takeover, genuine header
progress, repeated batches, import/reset lifecycle and the previous ownership
regressions. Independent source review found no blocking issue. Broader results
are recorded below when complete.

Scope: header scheduling and its diagnostics only. Block-request, ping, socket,
and consensus wall clocks remain unchanged. This does not establish whole-node
clock-jump resilience, native non-Linux acceptance, or public-network IBD rates.
No validation predicate, PoW, monetary, transaction or upgrade rule changed.
The next networking slice is inventory send-buffer refusal: reproduce whether
newly reserved but unsent requests prevent immediate reassignment, preserving
previously issued requests and their stall age.

Final validation for the header-clock slice:

- Full rebuilt Boost suite: 483/483 cases, 143,037,029 assertions, 468.55 seconds.
- GoogleTest upgrade activation/epoch checks: 6/6.
- Selective ASan/UBSan with leak detection: both clock cases, the RPC diagnostic
  case, and all 44 download cases pass; full download run 152.23 seconds with no
  findings. All four changed translation units (`main.cpp`, `utiltime.cpp`,
  `rpc/net.cpp`, and the download tests) were instrumented; other dependencies
  and objects were not.
- The separate daemon passes isolated regtest startup and SIGTERM shutdown
  (exit 0), plus full RELRO, canary, NX, PIE and no-RPATH/RUNPATH inspection.
- Diff checks and independent review pass. The exact source is
  `0282a7637ee0c747724e228d07ca34acb9a36e1b` plus source/test patch SHA256
  `9ee0fc9169fb5ab50550be29ca966351b23352217643409fd8982df3593a0939`.
